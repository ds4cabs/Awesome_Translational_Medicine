Potential of AI in Health Care
- AI holds significant promise in improving health, guiding clinical decisions, and advancing research. However, the actual use of AI in health care is still limited, with modest adoption rates among medical practices and physicians.
Evidence-Based Evaluation
- AI must be evaluated with the same rigor as other medical tools, through evidence-based methods like randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Existing RCTs on AI interventions show positive outcomes in patient care, but many have methodological issues that undermine their validity.

Systematic Reviews and Findings
- Systematic reviews from 2021 to 2023 reveal that only a small fraction of AI studies are RCTs, though most show positive outcomes.
- The reviews highlight the need for continuous evaluation of AI systems post-market (algorithmovigilance), similar to drug pharmacovigilance.

Learning from Failures
- Examples include AI-assisted colonoscopy screenings and hospital readmission prediction models, where studies found no significant improvement despite accurate predictions.
- These failures indicate the need for better implementation strategies and further research.

Future Directions
- Conduct robust RCTs to identify the most effective AI interventions.
- Focus on translational AI to move promising research into practical applications.
- Encourage academic programs to pursue research that advances AI along the translational spectrum.
