Despite the hype, there's limited evidence of the effectiveness and safety of big data applications in practice. Rigorous research and validation are necessary to realize the potential benefits.

While genomic data enhances risk prediction and drug discovery, challenges remain in variant classification and phenotypic definition. Tools like Mendelian randomization and phenome-wide association studies are useful but require robust causal inference.

EHR data is prone to biases, misclassification, and confounding variables. Larger datasets may exacerbate these issues. Rigorous research is essential to validate ML models based on genomic and EHR data.

Translational and data scientists must lead the validation of ML applications, ensuring they meet regulatory standards before clinical adoption. Partnerships between academia and the tech industry are crucial for developing feasible and effective products.

Ethical and regulatory considerations are crucial to avoid risks and ensure successful implementation.
