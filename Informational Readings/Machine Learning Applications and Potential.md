Introduction to Machine Learning (ML):
- ML is a tool for turning vast amounts of data into knowledge, enabling computers to make decisions and predictions without rules-based programming.
- - ML is categorized into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Types of Machine Learning:
- Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models for predictions (e.g., classification and regression).
- Unsupervised Learning: Identifies hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimension reduction techniques).
- Reinforcement Learning: Learns from trial and error to improve decision-making (e.g., training algorithms for games, self-driving cars, treatment regimes).

Applications in Translational Research and Medicine:
- Medical Imaging: ML can automate and improve the accuracy of diagnoses (e.g., detecting tumors, analyzing histologic slides).
- Genomic Data Analysis: ML helps predict genetic mutations and their consequences, aiding in disease prognosis and personalized medicine.
- Drug Discovery and Development: ML accelerates the process by improving decision-making and reducing failure rates.
- Personalized Medicine: ML enables medical decisions based on individual patient characteristics, moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach.
