Here are the key git commands to know.
- git init: initializes the memory storage
- git add: adds specific changes that you want to save to the "staging area" (pre-saving)
- git commit: commits those changes to memory (git commit -m "Insert message describing commit here")
- git log: shows all of your past commits
- git checkout: allows you to go back in time to a different save point

- Each person can put all of their files/commit history/git from their computer onto the website. Every other person can then download their files/commit history/git, look through the different changes, make their own changes, and push it back onto the website.
- Push: you push files from your computer onto the website. (uploading)
- Pull: you pull someone's files from the website onto your computer. (downloading)
